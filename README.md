# House-Rent-Prediction-in-India

##Introduction and Assumption:
Dataset focuses on house rentals in India, encompassing various factors like size, BHK, furnishing status, etc.
Aim: Understand how factors like BHK, house size, and furnishing status impact rental prices in different cities.
Hypothesis: BHK, house size, and furnishing status significantly influence house rental, supported by descriptive, dispersion, and regression analyses.

##Conclusion:
Hypothesis Partially Validated: BHK, size, and furnishing status are primary factors affecting rent in each city.
Data Analysis Techniques: Descriptive, dispersion, regression analysis, data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

##Findings Summary:
BHK, size, and furnishing status are most crucial, followed by point of contact and bathroom.
Rent varies across cities, highest in Mumbai, lowest in Kolkata.
Furnished houses command higher rent, but its impact is less than other factors.
Random forest model excels in predictive performance (98.59% R-squared), capturing data variance effectively.
Decision tree model balances performance and interpretability.
Linear regression model indicates potential non-linear relationships not captured.

##Limitations and Recommendations:
Dataset Representativeness: Limited to six cities, potential selection bias; recommend expanding data collection to enhance generalizability.
Missing Features: Important factors like location, amenities, property age not considered; suggest adding more features for accuracy.
Data Quality Concerns: Outliers or errors may impact results; propose additional data cleaning and validation steps.
Model Limitations: Assumptions and constraints in the models used; advise exploring different models or parameters for a better fit
